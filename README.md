# How

This is my blog about how I do things. I'm a programmer, so I'll be writing about programming, but I'll also be writing about other things that I do.

I'm quite old and sometime I forget how to use this repo.
Dear me in the future, here is how to use it.

## Clone the repo

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:RoBYCoNTe/blog.robertoconterosito.it.git
```

Enjoy!
