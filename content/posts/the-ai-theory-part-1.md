_Welcome back to my dev notes!_

Today I'm starting a new series of posts about AI. I'm going to explain the main concepts of AI and how they work.

**I'm going to start from the very beginning, so if you are already familiar with AI you can skip this post.**

Why I'm doing this? I want to understand how AI works and I want to share my knowledge with you guys. I'm late to the party, but I'm here now and I'm going to learn as much as I can because I have to apply this knowledge in my job for a project I'm working on.

## What is AI?

AI is the acronym for Artificial Intelligence. We have to distinguish between AI and Machine Learning. AI is a very broad field that includes Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a subfield of AI that studies how to make computers learn from data.

We can have a brief resume of main concepts:

- _Artificial Intelligence_ is the science of making things smart.
- _Narrow AI_ explict the concept of AI applied to a specific domain: thing that can do one or more tasks better then human (ex. classifying texts or detect tumors in medical images).
- _Machinge Learning (ML)_ is the implementation of the actual program that learns from prior experience to find patterns in dataset (and is in contrast with traditional programming, no hand-code rules to process data and obtain the answer you need).
- _Deep Learning (DL)_ is a subfield of ML that uses a neural network to learn from data.

### Deep Learning

I want to focus on Deep Learning because it's the most interesting part of AI. A neural network is a computational model that is inspired by the structure of the human brain.

In some way a deep neural network act like a child that learns from his parents. The child is born with a random set of weights and he learns from his parents. The parents are the ones that teach the child how to behave in the world.

See you in the next post!
